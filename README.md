Honesty and fairness are considered fundamental values shared by students, staff and faculty at the University of Toronto.

The Universityâ€™s policies and procedures that deal with cases of cheating, plagiarism and other forms of academic misconduct, are designed to protect the integrity of the institution and to maintain a community where competition is fair.

As a result, U of T treats cases of academic misconduct very seriously. If it has been alleged you committed an academic offence, you will find that the allegation is dealt with formally and seriously, and the penalties can be severe if it is determined that you did cheat.

All of the policies and procedures surrounding academic offences are dealt within one policy: The Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters.
